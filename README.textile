h1. Jogger Web Framework

Jogger is a lightweight Java library for building Web Applications. It provides a *routing mechanism* - that allows you to map HTTP requests to Java methods - and *a view template engine based on "FreeMarker":http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/*. The truth is that I just wanted a super simple Java web framework that would allow me to:

* _Use a better request/response API_: The Servlet API sucks.
* _Map HTTP requests to Java methods_: similar to Play! Framework (which is inspired by Ruby on Rails).
* _Define views and layouts_: reuse layouts in multiple views.
* _Plug into any project_: let me choose the project structure and the libraries/frameworks I want to use; don't make this hard on me.
* _Deploy into any Servlet Container_: such as Jetty, JBoss, etc.

So, I made Jogger - I really like the name BTW ;)
